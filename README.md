### Motivation

eBay hides away the actual price realised on listings where the seller accepted an offer on the item. This means that if an item was listed for $1,000 but actually sold to a buyer who only offered $5, eBay would by default show the item as having sold for $1,000. This adds a link to various eBay websites to reveal exactly what these listings sold for.
